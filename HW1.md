OVERVIEW

Update the README.md file for your startup GitHub repository that you created in the earlier instruction to include your startup specification. This should include an elevator pitch, key features, a description of how you will use each technology, and design images. Make sure you push your changes to the file so that it can be reviewed.

Submit the URL for your GitHub startup repository to the Canvas assignment.


SPECIFCS

1. Create an elevator pitch for your application. Something that would excite an investment firm if you happen to catch a ride up the elevator with one of their representatives. Or maybe just sound cool to your friends if they are your target audience. This should be no more than a paragraph in length.

2. Sketch out what the application looks like.

3. Represent all technologies
HTML - Basic structural and organizational elements
CSS - Styling and animating
JavaScript - Interactivity (e.g. What happens when a user presses a button)
Web service - Remote functions that your application calls on your, and someone else's, web server (e.g. saveScores, getWeather, chatWithFriend)
Authentication: An input for your user to create an account and login. You will want to display the user's name after they login.
Database data: A rendering of application data that is stored in the database. For Simon, this is the high scores of all players.
WebSocket data: A rendering of data that is received from your server. This may be realtime data sent from other users (e.g. chat or scoring data), or realtime data that your service is generating (e.g. stock prices or latest high scores). For Simon, this represents every time another user creates or ends a game.

4. Take some time to properly learn how to use Markdown in your README.md and notes.md files. Read the GitHub documentation (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) for examples on how to use Markdown. Refer to the example design to see how to embed images. Make sure your images are in a format that browsers natively support such as JPG, GIF, or PNG.
