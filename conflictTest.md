1. Open up the repository directory in VS Code and create a file named conflictTest.md. Add some text to the file.
2. Use the Git functionality of VS Code to add conflictTest.md to Git, commit your changes, and push them to GitHub.
3. In GitHub modify your conflictTest.md file and commit the changes.
4. In VS Code pull down and review the changes.
5. Make another change to the conflictTest.md file on GitHub and commit the change.
6. Before you pull the changes to your development environment, change the same line in the conflictTest.md file and commit the change.
7. Attempt to pull the GitHub changes to your development environment. Note and resolve the merge conflict. Commit the merged changes. Push the merge commit.
8. On GitHub observe the resolved merge.


I've now added additional text on Github, thus completing step 3.

This is step 5.

This is step 6.
